  abstract       = {This classic text on multiple regression is noted for
                   its nonmathematical, applied, and data-analytic
                   approach. Readers profit from its verbal-conceptual
                   exposition and frequent use of {examples.The} applied
                   emphasis provides clear illustrations of the principles
                   and provides worked examples of the types of
                   applications that are possible. Researchers learn how
                   to specify regression models that directly address
                   their research questions. An overview of the
                   fundamental ideas of multiple regression and a review
                   of bivariate correlation and regression and other
                   elementary statistical concepts provide a strong
                   foundation for understanding the rest of the text. The
                   third edition features an increased emphasis on
                   graphics and the use of confidence intervals and effect
                   size measures, and an accompanyingawebsite with data
                   for most of the numerical examples along with the
                   computer code for {SPSS}, {SAS}, and {SYSTAT}, at

                   Regression serves as both a textbook for graduate
                   students and as a reference tool for researchers in
                   psychology, education, health sciences, communications,
                   business, sociology, political science, anthropology,
                   and economics. An introductory knowledge of statistics
                   is required. Self-standing chapters minimize the need

                   analysis. Through algebraic and interpretive proofs,
                   some of the most commonly made mistakes are explicated
                   and illustrated. The theoretical problem underlying
                   each is highlighted, and suggested solutions are
