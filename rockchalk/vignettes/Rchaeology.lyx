\begin_layout Section
Introduction: R Idioms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This vignette is about the R idioms I have learned while working on the
 rockchalk package.
 At the current time, I don't understand all of the R idioms that are common
 in the advanced R programmers' conversation, but I am getting some traction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a language gap between an R user and an R programmer.
 Users write 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

scripts
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that use functions from R packages.
 Users don't write (many) functions.
 Users don't make packages.
 And many users are happy to keep it that way.
 For users who want to become programmers, there is usually a harsh awakening.
 R for development is a different language.
 Well, that's wrong.
 It is a different dialect.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A transitional R user will have to learn a lot of terminology and undergo
 a change of paradigm.
 There are resources available! Everybody should subscribe to the email
 lists for the R project (
\begin_inset Flex URL
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://www.r-project.org/mail.html
\end_layout

\end_inset

), especially r-help (for user questions) and r-devel.
 Rchaeologically speaking, that is the native habitat of the R programmers.
 There is also a burgeoning collection of blogs and Web forums, perhaps
 most notably the R section on StackExchange (
\begin_inset Flex URL

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 Excellent books have been published.
 As an Rcheologist, I am drawn to the books that are written by the R insiders.
 
\emph on

, by William Venables and Brian Ripley 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\emph on

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, are, well, awesome.
 In 2012, I started teaching R programming using Norman Matloff's, 
\emph on
The Art of R Programming
\emph default
 (2012), which I think is great and recommend strongly (even though Professor
 Matloff is not one of the R Core Team members, so far as I know).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are now three types of object-oriented programming in R (S3, S4, and
 reference classes) and the programmer is apparently free to select among
 them without prejudice.
 The best brief explanation of S3 that I've found is in Friedrich Leisch's
 brief note about R packaging, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Creating R Packages: A Tutorial
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (2009).
 One should be mindful of the fact that R is provided with several manuals,
 one of which is the 
\emph on
R Language Definition
\emph default
.
 I find that one difficult to understand, and I usually can't understand
 it until I search through the R source code and packages for usage examples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I usually approach R coding in three phases.
 I write code that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

works
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, however tedious and slow it might be.
 There will be a lot of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

copy and paste
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 constructions with tedious, manual editing of commands.
 Then I read through the code and look for repetitious elements, and I re-organi
ze to make functions that abstract that work.
 If there are any stanzas that look mostly the same, except that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

x1
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is repalced by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

x2
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, I know the work is not done.
 Finally, I look through the code to find 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dumb
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 constructions that can be cleaned up and completed with fewer lines.
 A dumb construction is one that I would be ashamed to show to an expert
 R programmer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beginning R programmers, the ones who have never studied C or Java or Fortran,
 will often become 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stuck
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in stage one of that process.
 Experienced programmers with more formal training will usually have the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

little voice
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the back of their minds saying 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

there's a better way,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and, unfortunately, R novices don't hear that voice.
 Lacking some of the discipline imposed by those other languages, the usual
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rambling
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 R script will seem 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

good enough.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The first step for the transitional R programmer, the one who does not
 want to be a novice any more, is to take a harsh look at the code that
 has already been written.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rockchalk package has many functions that receive fitted regression
 models and re-arrange their components for re-fitting or plotting.
 A good deal of the advice I have to offer is about the process of managing
 R formula, but I have also accumulated some lessons in argument handling.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
do.call(), eval(), substitute(), formula().
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the transitional programmer understands these four functions, she/he
 will be well on the way to escaping the category of novice R programmer.
 The other benefit is that the code written by the experts, including the
 R source code itself, will become much more understandable.

\begin_layout Subsection
Rewriting Formulas.
 My Introductory Puzzle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On May 29, 2012, I was working on a regression problem in the rockchalk
 package.
 I have a number of functions that receive elementary regressions and then
 change them.
 I need to receive a fitted model, extract the formula, change some variables,
 and then revise the formula to match the new variables.
 And then run the model over again.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The functions meanCenter() and residualCenter() receive a fitted regression
 model, transform some variables, and then fit a new regression.
 Suppose a regression has been fitted as

 The R result will estimate a predictive formula such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{y}_{i}=\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x1_{i}+\hat{\beta}_{2}x2_{i}++\hat{\beta}_{3}x1_{i}\cdot x2_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 meanCenter() will replace the non-centered variables

x1
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

x2

x1c
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

x2c
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The original formula y ~ x1*x2 must be replaced with y ~ x1c*x2c.
 I found this to be a very complicated problem with a very satisfying answer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My first effort used R's update function.
 That is the most obvious approach.
 I learned very quickly that update() is not sufficient.
 It is fairly easy to replace x1 with x1c in the formula, but not when x1
 is logged or otherwise transformed.
 Here is the runable example code that demonstrates the problem.

That's very clever, I think.
 It packs together a half-dozen very deep thoughts.
 It has most of the essential secrets of R's guts, laid out in a single
 line.
 It has do.call(), substitute(), it interprets a formula as a list, and it
 shows that every command in R is, when it comes down to brass tacks, a
 list.

do.call() and eval()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In my early work as an Rchaeologist, I had noticed eval() and do.call(),
 but did not understand their significance.
 Coming to grips with these ideas is a critical step in the R programmer's
 growth, because they separate the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

script writer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

language programmer.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Whenever difficult problems arise in r-help, the answer almost invariably
 involves do.call() or eval().
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
do.call()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's concentrate on do.call first.
 The syntax is like this
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

do.call("someRFunction", aListOfArgumentsToGoInTheParentheses)
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is as if we were telling R to run this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

someRFunction(aListOfArgumentsToGoInTheParentheses)
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use do.call() because it is much more flexible than calling someRFunction()
 directly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's consider an example that runs a regression the ordinary way, and then
 with do.call.
 In this example, the role of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

someRFunction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will be played by lm() and the list of arguments will be the parameters
 of the regression.
 The regression m1 will be constructed the ordinary way, while m2 is constructed
 with do.call().
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<<>>=

\begin_layout Plain Layout

m1 <- lm(y ~ x1*x2, data = dat)

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

regargs <- list(formula = y ~ x1*x2, data = quote(dat))
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

m2 <- do.call("lm", regargs)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

coef(m2)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

all.equal(m1, m2)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

@
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The object regargs is a list of arguments that R can understand when they
 are supplied to the lm function.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
do.call() is a powerful, mysterious symbol.
 It holds flexibility; we can calculate 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

on the language
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to create commands and then run them.
 I first needed do.call() when we had a simulation project that ran very
 slowly.
 There's a writeup in the working examples distributed with rockchalk called
 stackListItems-01.R.
 I was using rbind() over and over to join the results of simulation runs.
 Basically, the code was like this
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

for (i in 1:10000){
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

   dat <- someHugeSimulation(i)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

   result <- rbind(result, dat)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That will call rbind() 10000 times.
 I had not realized that rbind() is time-consuming.
 It accesses a new chunk of memory each time it is run.
 On the other hand, we could collect those results in a list, then we can
 call rbind() one time to smash together all of the results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

for (i in 1:10000){
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

   mylist[[i]] <- someHugeSimulation(i)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

result <- do.call("rbind", mylist)
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is much faster to run rbind() only once.
 It would be OK if we typed it all out like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

result <- rbind(mylist[[1]], mylist[[2]], mylist[[3]], ..., mylist[[10000])
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But who wants to do all of that typing? How tiresome! Thanks to Erik Iverson
 in r-help, I understand that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

result <- do.call("rbind", mylist)
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
is doing the EXACT same thing.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mylist
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a list of arguments.
 do.call is 
\emph on
constructing
\emph default
 a function call from the list of arguments.
 It is 
\emph on
as if
\emph default
 I had actually typed rbind with 10000 arguments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The beauty in this is that we could design a program that can assemble the
 list of arguments, and also choose the function to be run, on the fly.
 We are not required to literally write the function in quotes, as in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rbind
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 We could instead have a variable that is calculated to select one function
 among many, and then use do.call on that.
 In a very real sense, we could write a program that can write itself as
 it runs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From all of this (and a peek at ?call), I arrive at an Rchaeological eureka!
 A call object is a quoted command plus a list of arguments for that command.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
eval()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where does eval() fit into the picture? do.call() manufactures a call and
 executes it immediately.
 It is possible to arrest the process mid stream, to capture the call without
 evaluating it with eval().
 The terminology in the R documentation on this is difficult, mainly because
 there are several different ways to create a piece of not-yet-evaluated
 code.
 By 
\begin_inset Flex Strong

\begin_layout Plain Layout
not-yet-evaluated code
\end_layout

\end_inset

, I mean an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unevaluated expression
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

call object
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, anything that can be handled by the eval() function.
 A not-yet-evaluated object holds some syntax that can we need later.
 I think of do.call() as a contraction of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

eval
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

call
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 As far as I can tell, do.call("lm", list(arguments)) is the same as eval(call(
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rbind
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, arguments)).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many ways to ask R to create the not-yet-evaluated object, that's
 one of the confusing things (in my opinion).
 Most obviously, call() function can be used for that.
 But functions like quote() and expression() can also create not-yet-evaluated
 code.

\begin_layout Standard
Everybody has experienced an error like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Error: object 'x1' not found
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whenever we use a variable, the R interpreter expects to find it.
 We know those variables are in the data frame dat, but the interpreter
 does not know that's what we mean.
 But we can ask R to trust us with the quote() function, which, basically,
 means 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

here's some code we will evaluate later
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

> mycall <- quote(x1 + x2)
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The object 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mycall
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is an R call object, something that might be evaluated in the future.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we want to evaluate 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

x1 + x2
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, we ask R do to so:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

eval(mycall, dat)
\end_layout

\end_inset

The second argument supplies the place where x1 and x2 are to be found.
 R users may never have noticed the eval() function, but most will have
 used the with() function, which is simply a clever re-phrasing of the eval
 function's interface.
 It does the same thing:
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

with(dat, x1 + x2)
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and so does 
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

with(dat, eval(mycall)).
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, back to the regression example we were working on before.
 We can create the call object using the call() function, which requires
 the name of a function and a comma-separated list of quoted arguments.
 I quote each of the bits of syntax in the arguments because I don't want
 R to replace 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with the actual data frame, I only want it to remember the name.

The main reason for using eval is that we can 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

piece together
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 commands and then run them after we have assembled all the pieces.
 The nickname for this seems to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

computing on the language.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 There is a discussion of it in the R Language Definition.

Did you ever notice that you get an error if you run

\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

 x1 + x2
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, then there is no error? It is as if R is wrapping your code in protective
 tissue, something like quote().
 However, the protective wrapper in this case is actually the function called
 formula().
 The R interpreter notices the symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

 in the syntax, and so it assumes you meant to run

\begin_layout Standard
Now we turn back to the main theme.
 How is eval() used in functions? Some functions take a lot of arguments.
 We may want to do a lot of fine tuning on the arguments, before they are
 assembled and evaluated.
 Hence, it is very important that we can keep some bits of R that are symbolic,
 rather than calculated, until we need them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are looking for examples of eval() in the R source code, there is
 a nice one in the beginning of the lm() function.
 Suppose a user submits a command like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lm(y ~ x, data = dat, x = TRUE, y = TRUE).
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Inside lm(), the import is re-organized.
 Here are the first lines of the lm() function

 the function, stepping through line-by-line.
 In line 8, the match.call() function is used to grab a copy of the command
 that I typed.
 We can see that mf is exactly the same as my command, except R has named
 the arguments:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That's not just a string of letters, however.
 It is a call object, a list with individual pieces that can be revised.
 Recall that the first element in a call object is the name of a function,
 and the following elements are the arguments.
 Lines 10 and 11 check the names of mf for the presence of certain arguments,
 and throw away the rest.
 It only wants the arguments we would be needed to run the function model.frame.
 Line 12 adds an argument to the list, drop.unused.levels.
 Up to that point, then, we can look at the individual pieces of mf:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 Line 13 replaces the element 1 in mf with the symbol 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

model.frame
\begin_inset Quotes erd

.
 That's the function that will be called.
 Line 14 is the coup de grâce, when the revised call 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

mf
\begin_inset Quotes erd

It would not do to simply write that into the lm function, however, because
 some people use variables that have names different from y, x1, and x2,
 and their data objects may not be called dat.
 lm allows users to input whatever they want for a formula and data, and
 then lm takes what it needs to build a model frame.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
substitute()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most R users I know have not used substitute, except possibly if they try
 to use plotmath.
 In the context of plotmath, the problem is as follows.
 Plotmath causes the R plot functions to convert expressions into mathematical
 symbols in a way that is reminiscent of LaTeX.
 For example, a command like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

text(4, 4, expression(gamma))
\end_layout

\end_inset

will draw the gamma symbol at the position (4,4).
 We can use paste to combine symbolic commands and text like so:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

text(4, 4, expression(paste(gamma, " = 7")))
\end_layout

\end_inset

The number 7 is a nice number, but what if we want to calculate something
 and insert it into the expression? Your first guess might be to insert
 a function that makes a calculation, such as the mean, but this fails:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

text(4, 4, expression(paste(gamma, mean(x))))
\end_layout

\end_inset

In order to smuggle the result of a calculation into an expression, some
 fancy footwork is required.
 In the help page for plotmath, examples using the functions bquote and
 substitute are offered.
 I have found this to be quite frustrating and difficult to do, and if one
 examines my collection of examples on 
\begin_inset Flex URL
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://pj.freefaculty.org/R/WorkingExamples
\end_layout

\end_inset

, one will find quite a few plotmath exercises.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the particular purpose of blending expressions with calculation results,
 I find the bquote function to be more easily understandable.
 However, when going beyond plotmath, I expect most R programmers will need
 to use substitute() instead, so I will discuss that in this section.
 The plotmath help page points to syntax like this:

 parse tree? We've seen expressions already, that part is not so off putting.
 But 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

parse tree
\begin_inset Quotes erd

? Really?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is one of those points at which being an Rchaeologist has real benefits.
 We have to dig deeper, to try to understand not only what the R programmer
 says, but what she is actually trying to do.
 The manual page gives us some insights into the R programmer, and it is
 his or her view of his or her own actions, but it doesn't necessarily speak
 to how we should understand substitute().
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For me, the only workable approach is to build up a sequence of increasingly
 complicated examples.
 I start by creating the list of replacements.
 This replacement list can have a format like this: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<<>>=
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

sublist <- list(x1 = "alphabet", x2 = "zoology")
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

@
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose I have some other object in which x1 and x2 need to be replaced.
 Specifically, when an expression has 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

x1
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, I want 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

alphabet
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

x2
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 should become 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

zoology.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The quotes in the R code indicate that alphabet and zoology are character
 strings, not other objects that already exist.
 Consider replacing x1 and x2 in x1 + x2 + log(x1) + x3:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<<>>=
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

substitute(expression(x1 + x2 + log(x1) + x3), sublist)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

@
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the substitution 1) leaves other variables alone (since they are
 not named in sublist) and 2) it finds all valid uses of the symbols x1
 and x2 and replaces them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This isn't quite what I wanted, however, because the strings have been inserted
 into the middle of my expression.
 I don't want text.
 I just want symbols.
 I've seen the conversion from character to symbol done with as.symbol()
 and with as.name(), recently I realized that they are synonymous.
 I usually use as.symbol() because that name has more intuition for me, but
 in Gabor's answer to my question, as.name() is used.
 Using as.name(), my example would become:

setNames and names
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Almost every R user has noticed that the elements of R lists can have names.
 In a data frame, the names of the list elements are thought of as variable
 names, or column names.
 If dat is a data frame, the names and colnames functions return the same
 thing, but that's not true for other types of objects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

names(dat)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After dat is created, we can change the names inside it with a very similar
 approach:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<<>>=
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

colnames(dat)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

@
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While used interactively, this is convenient, but it is a bit tedious because
 we have to create dat first, and then set the names.
 The setNames() function allows us to do this in one shot.
 I'll paste the data frame creating commands and the name vector in for
 a first try:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

    x3 = rnorm(10), x4 = gl(2,5)), c("good", "names", "tough", "find"))
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

head(dat2, 2)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

@
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to make this more generally useful, the first step is to take the
 data-frame-creating code and set it into an expression that is not immediately
 evaluated (that's datcommand in what follows).
 When I want the data frame to be created, I use eval(), and then the newnames
 vector is put to use.

dat3 <- setNames(eval(datcommand), newnames)

 the names, and creates the data frame, and then they all come together.

The Big Finish

\begin_layout Standard
In the meanCenter() function in rockchalk, some predictors are mean-centered
 and their names are revised.
 A variable named 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

age
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 becomes 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

agec
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

x1
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 becomes 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

x1c
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 So the user's regression formula that uses variables age or x1 must be
 revised.
 This is a function that takes a formula

Some people prefer this more elaborate declaration.
 This succeeds because the variables that are declared in the beginning
 of the list are available for calculations in the later part of the list.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That will often be sufficient, but we have not protected ourselves as well
 as we might.
 Suppose the user's code ends up supplying a NULL value for 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout
z
\end_layout

\end_inset

, as in 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
plotme(x, y, z = NULL)
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 They would not do that on purpose, but it might be an accident.
 If 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
z
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is calculated in their code and something has gone wrong.
 To protect against that, we find this idiom is used in the R source code
 quite often:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Plain Layout

plotme <- function(x, y, z){

Sometimes even more elaborate argument checking will be required.

If possible, design your function so that it runs with a minimum number
 of arguments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Take a look at the most commonly used functions in R, such as lm() or plot.defaul
t().
 These functions allow a great many arguments, but they will deliver what
 the users minimally need if the users supply a formula and a data frame.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have made many mistakes in designing function in rockchalk.
 From one month to the next, I would learn ways to simplify arguments or
 eliminate them entirely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I did not initially understand the flexibility that R allows in the types
 of arguments passed to a function.
 Because we can deduce information from the arguments that are passed in,
 we can eliminate the need for the user to pass in other arguments.
 We would never need to require both arguments x and xlab in the plot function,
 for example.
 xlab is optional because, In particular, I insisted that users supply quoted
 strings as variable names for the arguments plotx and modx.
 I insisted on this syntax, as illustrated in the example for plotSlopes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Today, the following syntax works just as well

\begin_layout Plain Layout

m7 <- lm(statusquo ~ region * income, data= Chile)

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

@
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is no longer necessary to quote the income and region variable because
 the function checks the argument and, if necessary, it manufactures the
 string for the user.
 This is what I have in the beginning of plotSlopes.

\begin_layout Standard
If plotx and modx are already character strings, then this has no effect.
 If they are symbols, however, this turns them into character strings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the olden days,when I first started using R, it was necessary to explicitly
 quite many arguments that we do not quite anymore.
 Today, for example, both library(
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rockchalk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) and library(rockchalk) will work.
 The latter did not work in the beginning, however.
 If you go looking at old R code, from 1999 or 2000, you will find many
 more variables are quoted.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This idiom is widely used in the R source code to eliminate the user tedium
 of typing quotation marks.
 Note that today, these commands have the same effect:
\end_layout

This trick is put to use in the plot.default() function in R, where the user
 can supply an argument xlab or ylab if desired, but the plot.default will
 create those values if they are not supplied.

Do This, Not That (Stub)

\begin_layout Standard
R novices sometimes use Google to search for R advice and they find it,
 good or bad.
 They may find their way to the r-help email list, where advice is generally
 good, or to the StackOverflow pages for R, which may be better.
 A lot of advice is offered by people like me, who may have good intentions,
 but are simply not qualified to offer advice.

\begin_layout Standard
One of the few bits of advice that seems to grab widespread support is that
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

for loops are bad.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 One can write an lapply statement in one line, while a for loop can take
 3 lines.
 The code is shorter, but it won't necessarily run more quickly.
 I recall being jarred by this revelation in John Chambers's book, 
\emph on
Software for Data Analysis
\emph default
.
 The members of the apply family (apply, lapply, sapply, etc) can make for
 more readable code, but they aren't always faster.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

However, none of the apply mechanisms changes the number of times the supplied
 function is called, so serious improvements will be limited to iterating
 simple calculations many times.
 Otherwise, the n evaluations of the function can be expected to be the
 dominant fraction of the computation
