Description: A collection of functions for ease of
    presentation and interpretation of regression analysis.
    These functions are used to produce the statistics lectures
    that are available in http://pj.freefaculty.org/guides. There
    are functions to explore the effect (or lack thereof) from
    "mean centering," "residual centering", and standardization.
    The vignette "rockchalk" offers a fairly comprehensive overview.
    The vignette "Rstyle" has advice about coding in R.
    See the outreg function for a convenient way to generate
    regression models for reports. For nice, easy to use pictures,
    see plotSlopes, plotCurves, plotPlane.
    The package title "rockchalk" refers to our school motto,
    "Rock Chalk Jayhawk, Go K.U.".
