Description: A collection of functions for interpretation and presentation
    of regression analysis.  These functions are used
    to produce the statistics lectures in
    <http://pj.freefaculty.org/guides>. Includes regression
    diagnostics, regression tables, and plots of interactions and
    "moderator" variables. The emphasis is on "mean-centered" and
    "residual-centered" predictors. The vignette 'rockchalk' offers a
    fairly comprehensive overview.  The vignette 'Rstyle' has advice
    about coding in R.  The package title 'rockchalk' refers to our
    school motto, 'Rock Chalk Jayhawk, Go K.U.'.
